# PEP 508 allows only URLs such as `foo @ https://example.org/foo` or `foo @ file:///home/ferris/foo`, and
# arguably does not allow relative paths in file URLs (`foo @ file://./foo`,
# `foo @ file:foo-3.0.0-py3-none-any.whl`, `foo @ file://foo-3.0.0-py3-none-any.whl`), as they are not part of the
# relevant RFCs, even though widely supported. Pip accepts relative file URLs and paths instead of urls
# (`foo @ ./foo-3.0.0-py3-none-any.whl`). The `non-pep508-features` controls whether these non-spec features will
# be supported.
